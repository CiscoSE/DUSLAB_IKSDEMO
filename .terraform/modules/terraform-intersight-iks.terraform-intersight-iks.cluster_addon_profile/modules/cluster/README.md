```hcl
module "iks_addon_policy" {

  source = "terraform-cisco-modules/iks/intersight//modules/addon_policy"

  # omitted...
}
```

This module is used to create IKS clusters.  It can be used standalone or with all of the other modules in this repo.  If it is used standalone, the lookups for the various MOIDs will need to be added.
