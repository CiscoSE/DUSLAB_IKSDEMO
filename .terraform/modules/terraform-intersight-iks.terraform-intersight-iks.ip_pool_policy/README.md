# Terraform Intersight Kubernetes Service Module

The Cisco Intersight Terraform Provider is available in the Terraform Registry at https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/intersight/latest.  This repository contains example modules that use the provider to create 

A terraform module to create a managed Kubernetes clusters using Intersight Kubernetes Service (IKS). Available through the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/intersight/latest).
<!-- Inspired by and adapted from [this doc](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/intersight/latest/docs) -->
and its [source code](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/terraform-provider-intersight).


## Assumptions

* You want to create an IKS cluster on your on-premises infrastructure using Intersight.
* These resources will be provided using Intersight and VMware vCenter 6.7.
* You've claimed vCenter using the Intersight Assist Appliance.

## Details

This module creates all of the resources required for IKS.  Those resources are identitified below.  It is designed as a quickstart/example of how to get an IKS cluster running.  More customization is being enabled but currently there are some caveats:

1.  Re-using IP Pools is not available in this module yet.  *this is a work in progress
2.  Currently 3 "t-shirt" sizes are built
    1.  Small - 4vcpu, 16GB Memory, 40GB Disk
    2.  Medium - 8vcpu, 24GB Memory, 60GB Disk
    3.  Large - 12vcpu, 32GB Memory, 80GB Disk

## Usage

See the [Examples](https://github.com/terraform-cisco-modules/terraform-intersight-iks/tree/main/examples) ---> Complete directory for usage of this module.

There are 4 example files below that are needed to use this module.  Create these files in the same directory, run terraform init.  You will then be ready to run terraform plan or terraform apply.

Change the variables in the terraform.tfvars file and the main.tf as needed.
See the above Examples folder for more information.
